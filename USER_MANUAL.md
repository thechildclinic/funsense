# School Health Screening System - User Manual

## 1. Introduction

### Purpose of the Application
Welcome to the School Health Screening System! This application helps nurses conduct comprehensive student health screenings efficiently using camera-based measurements and AI-powered insights.

### Target Users
Nurses and authorized healthcare personnel.

### IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER
This is a screening tool, **NOT for diagnosis.** AI suggestions and reports **MUST be validated by a qualified medical doctor.** Medical judgment is paramount.

## 2. Getting Started

### Accessing the Application
Open `index.html` in a modern web browser (Chrome, Edge, etc.) on your computer or tablet. Internet is needed for AI features.

### Browser Requirements & Permissions
Use an up-to-date browser. **Allow camera and microphone permissions** when prompted.

## 3. Application Settings (Gear Icon <i class="fas fa-cog"></i>)
Before starting, or at any time, you can access settings by clicking the <i class="fas fa-cog"></i> gear icon, usually at the top right.
*   **Preferred Camera/Microphone:** If your device has multiple cameras/microphones, you can select your preferred one here for the app to try using first.
*   **Clear All Cached Screening Data:** This button will remove ALL incomplete screening data saved in the browser's local storage. Use with caution â€“ it's for clearing old/stuck data and cannot be undone.
*   **Device SDK Connections:** Placeholder for future integrations (e.g., specific medical devices).

## 4. Starting a Screening Session

1.  **Enter Student ID (Simulates QR Scan):**
    *   Type the student's ID. Click **"Start with Student ID"**. Mock data may pre-fill.
2.  **Enter Student Manually:**
    *   Click **"Enter Student Manually"**.
    *   Fill in: ID (Required), Name (Required), Age, Gender, **Pre-existing Conditions / Known Diseases** (e.g., "Asthma, Peanut Allergy"), and Reason for Manual Entry.
    *   Click **"Start Screening"**.
*   **Resuming a Session:** If a screening for this student was started earlier on *this device* and not submitted, you might be prompted to resume it.

## 5. Navigating Screening Modules

A header shows the current student. Top tabs allow direct navigation to modules: "Student Identification," "Anthropometry," "Specialized Imaging," "Vital Signs," "Review & Export." Grayed-out/struck-through tabs indicate skipped modules.

*   **"Next Step" / "Previous" Buttons:** For sequential navigation between *available* modules.
*   **Saving Progress:**
    *   Each module has a **"Save [Module Name] Data"** button (e.g., <i class="fas fa-save"></i> Save Anthropometry Data). Click this to save your current work for that student and module. A "Saved!" message appears briefly. Data is also saved automatically with major actions like BMI calculation.
*   **"Save & Return to Student List" Button:**
    *   After completing your assigned part(s) for a student, click the **"<i class="fas fa-list-alt"></i> Save & Return to Student List"** button (or similar name) at the bottom of a data entry module. This saves the current module's data and takes you back to the main start screen to select another student. The current student's record remains in `localStorage` for others (or yourself later) to continue on the same device.
*   **Skipping a Module:**
    1.  Click **"<i class="fas fa-ban"></i> Skip Module"** within a module.
    2.  Enter a "Reason for skipping."
    3.  Click **"Confirm Skip & Proceed"**.
    *   **Unskipping:** Navigate to a skipped module. Click **"<i class="fas fa-redo"></i> Unskip & Enter Data"**. Entering data also unskips it.

    *   After successful submission, the student's data is cleared from this tablet, and you return to the Start Screen.
    *   If submission fails (simulated), data remains locally; you can retry or export JSON.

## 7. Troubleshooting & Tips
*   **Camera Issues:** Check permissions, close other apps using camera. Use "Flip Camera" (<i class="fas fa-sync"></i>) if available.
*   **AI Errors:** Check internet. Service might be busy. API Key issues are for admins.
*   **Data Saving:** Use module "Save" buttons. In-progress data is saved to browser's local storage (same device).
*   **"Save & Return to Student List"** is your primary way to switch students after doing your part.
*   **Clear Instructions to Student:** Crucial for good captures.
